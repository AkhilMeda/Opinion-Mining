consisting of overall ratings, reviewtexts, summary, customer feedback across 5 different product categories to improve 
customer retention. 

• Spearheaded the project modeling, data collection, feature engineering, Imbalance Data sampling, and data preprocessing 

• Created Spark jobs and pipelines to deploy text preprocessing steps such as Tokenization, StopWords Remover, 
CountVectorizer, IDF vectorization, Bigrams converter, Hashing of relevant tokens. 

• Optimized the vocabulary of positive and negative tokens, enhanced the modeling by using Gradient Boosted Trees, Randomforets, Naïve Bayes classifier, 
Logistic Regression using Bigrams executed in Pyspark. Deployed the project in Amazon EMR, Pyspark kernel that reduced the execution time by 50% and 
enhanced customer retention by 30%
