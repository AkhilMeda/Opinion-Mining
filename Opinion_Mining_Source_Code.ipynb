I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)","Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy",1401840000,"Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner.

My skin is dry to normal and I haven't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I'll continue to alternate the three products.",1.0,["as","good","as","my","favorites","i've","been","using","neutrogena","fresh","foaming","cleanser","and","peter","thomas","roth","anti-aging","cleansing","gel","with","good","success","for","the","last","year","i","decided","to","try","alpha","hydrox","foaming","face","wash","based","on","good","reviews","see","beautypedia","dot","com","and","a","sale","price","the","first","time","i","washed","i","used","way","too","much","and","took","awhile","to","wash","it","all","off","after","that","i","switched","to","pea-sized","squirts","and","it","foams","up","and","cleans","great","my","skin","is","dry","to","normal","and","i","haven't","had","any","of","the","problems","reported","by","the","low","reviews","i'll","continue","to","alternate","the","three","products"],["good","favorites","using","neutrogena","fresh","foaming","cleanser","peter","thomas","roth","anti-aging","cleansing","gel","good","success","last","year","decided","try","alpha","hydrox","foaming","face","wash","based","good","reviews","see","beautypedia","dot","com","sale","price","first","time","washed","used","way","much","took","awhile","wash","switched","pea-sized","squirts","foams","cleans","great","skin","dry","normal","problems","reported","low","reviews","continue","alternate","three","products"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[3,5,8,16,19,22,28,31,37,39,41,48,54,55,56,81,120,124,211,237,276,332,347,351,389,402,474,498,508,659,674,951,1102,1227,1455,1490,1540,1772,2217,2315,2395,2592,2871,4303,4839,4858,6429,6681,6704,8131,9011,9198,10947,22622],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[3,5,8,16,19,22,28,31,37,39,41,48,54,55,56,81,120,124,211,237,276,332,347,351,389,402,474,498,508,659,674,951,1102,1227,1455,1490,1540,1772,2217,2315,2395,2592,2871,4303,4839,4858,6429,6681,6704,8131,9011,9198,10947,22622],"values":[1.5716067601508,4.8143287103838865,2.2293398638773105,2.041750122506523,2.102116253419351,2.2142154371841274,2.39818553592393,2.3064088002472714,2.392295206069719,2.395793381047444,2.803730481164387,2.724554109038063,2.8284650108009304,2.6460616175979115,2.6878387871924945,5.83072958869535,3.1017653606615947,6.585675161951469,3.5401977839489427,3.6456138844988097,3.7236204970681888,3.9431647643527517,3.9567294033868903,4.319492646192878,4.072428118061301,4.093952840600587,4.280985214795141,4.308646552883488,4.796719684323012,4.627370007537036,4.770699135621116,5.265669387597312,5.237966785047976,5.63526858251698,5.576079711126649,5.702520809526147,5.720065119177057,5.867600559885596,6.387009927342978,6.220619192621218,6.288569854529726,6.8921048763999835,13.467761742370179,7.529682205805118,7.427028051745035,7.356410484531081,7.882503580427861,7.844763252445014,8.005105902520194,8.307386774393127,8.575650760987806,8.501542788834085,8.655693468661342,9.754305757329453]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[-0.5785501720720898,0.5785501720720898]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[0.3592662672379857,0.6407337327620143]},1.0],["B000052YMG",2.0,"Didn't like the texture of this lotion.

I was on the hunt for a face lotion that had atleast SPF 30 and had light coverage. This seemed perfect. Unfortunately, it's too dry to really be a moisturizer. I find I have to use a serum (which I would use anyways at 34), a base lotion, then this on top for the spf coverage.  I don't hate this product. But there are some drawbacks:Cons:I have combo skin, oily on forehead and t-zone, but dry on cheecks. This is not moisturizing enough.Feels heavyGets REALLY greasyVery thick, almost like a foundation.BURNS MY EYES TERRIBLY. I can't use this around my eyes at all. I put it on with a foundation brush I lightly dab around the eye area. If I am in a hurry and just rub it on, it'll burn my eyes the rest of the day. (I don't wear contacts or anything.)Also, if you are outside and sweating it'll run into your eyes and sting.Seems to sit on top of the skin, instead of blending in.Has no anti-aging properties. Thought the soybeans would even skin tone or brighten...something! Nothing.Pros:Good coverage. I stopped using foundation when I started using this.Convienent pump bottle that locks for traveling.Size of the bottle will last FOREVER. One pump and your good to go.  If you use more than this, YOU WILL BE GREASY.Good for every day use. When I know I am going to be out in the sun all day, I use a 50 spf zinc cream. (I'm fair and burn easily.)I started using this when I was pregnant with #4. I know hormones do crazy things, but I got a horrible pregnancy mask while using this in the sun. I know masks are caused by hormones, but the sun accensenuates them. While I don't burn with this product, (I might get a little red, but not fry) this did not protect against the sun enough. Last winter,  I watched my mask fade. When the summer hit (after the baby was 9 months old) I would go back in the sun and it brought my mask out again in full force. I think this doesn't shield enough from the sun.I am currently looking for another lotion that has SPF and color that isn't greasy & won't sting my eyes. I have only continued to use this because most tinted moisturizers with spf are the same price for only 1.5 - 2 ounces. So price wise, this is a bargain.Also, I let my Mom try it & she said her eyes were tearing up constantly and burning as well.

I don't think I will repurchase this aveeno not to mention it is NOT sulfate free and I think it's the sulfates that keep my skin so dry after a shower..",0.0,["nothing","special","so","far","i","really","need","a","body","wash","for","my","very","dry","itchy","winter","skin","the","reviews","lead","me","to","purchase","this","one","but","so","far","it","has","made","no","more","difference","than","my","other","regular","body","washes","i","don't","get","it's","appeal","i","think","i","will","maybe","try","something","with","ceremides","perhaps","next","time","there","are","limited","choices","for","extra","dry","skin","from","what","i","can","see","i","don't","think","i","will","repurchase","this","aveeno","not","to","mention","it","is","not","sulfate","free","and","i","think","it's","the","sulfates","that","keep","my","skin","so","dry","after","a","shower"],["nothing","special","far","really","need","body","wash","dry","itchy","winter","skin","reviews","lead","purchase","one","far","made","difference","regular","body","washes","get","appeal","think","maybe","try","something","ceremides","perhaps","next","time","limited","choices","extra","dry","skin","see","think","repurchase","aveeno","mention","sulfate","free","think","sulfates","keep","skin","dry","shower"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[4,7,8,11,19,27,48,51,55,56,76,81,82,117,122,124,139,146,176,180,231,291,305,320,359,365,451,676,733,765,809,1073,1812,1889,1933,2484,2487,3254,3536,3832],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[4,7,8,11,19,27,48,51,55,56,76,81,82,117,122,124,139,146,176,180,231,291,305,320,359,365,451,676,733,765,809,1073,1812,1889,1933,2484,2487,3254,3536,3832],"values":[1.6468869456094777,1.743614218199151,6.688019591631932,1.8273422124664738,2.102116253419351,2.261127716374541,8.173662327114188,7.694848072384611,2.6460616175979115,2.6878387871924945,2.841811724000142,2.915364794347675,2.8920709936491247,3.0600531526248447,3.11051602418178,3.2928375809757346,3.159208536869273,3.217976544232057,6.733170082397232,7.252690931265866,3.657355702375493,3.7504186902229133,3.8327273376856366,3.878673025746592,4.143004135467416,4.04885800335419,4.2530475467847255,4.679131942095625,4.786230077651992,4.9441559906548225,4.892557243940914,5.174453379325651,6.296413031990752,6.273065667993761,5.9701161234111915,6.328415763076925,6.328415763076925,6.823112004913033,6.8639339994332875,7.151616071885068]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[2.045972957219257,-2.045972957219257]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[0.8855400755912703,0.11445992440872965]},0.0],["B00008J2XQ",5.0,"I'm one who needs to apply moisturizer all day long because my skin is so dry.

I thought I got cold but I asked my family members \"did you guys smell this??\" any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it's \"just oil now\"!! above half of the bottle still remains... I trashed it straight away..don't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name \"Xtremek\", that perfume oil still nice smell. I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium. but do not buy this \"Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\" from \"DayDream\" this is the my bad experience of this product....

Review about \"Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\" by DayDream..When I smell this perfume oil product, I like smell, it's light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle and I don't get any scent smell. I thought I got cold but I asked my family members \"did you guys smell this??\" any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it's \"just oil now\"!! above half of the bottle still remains... I trashed it straight away..don't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name \"Xtremek\", that perfume oil still nice smell.

It has worked fine but I keep trying different brands hoping to get a DEEP black color that lasts.  I have yet to find such a thing until now!  I've tried several types from the beauty supply store but this time I walked in and went up to the sales girl and said, \"I NEED a black color that will stay and I want it to be very black, what do you have?\"  She offered me two kinds with Bigen being one of them.  I was skeptical because it was a powder that you mix with water but the hair swatch was so beautiful and the sales girl told me that it would last and it WAS very dark.  So, I bought it.  It was on sale for 3.00 a box and she suggested two boxes (which I've never had to do), but it was fine.  Then I got home and chose to color immediately.  Logic told me there was NO way that the color was going to work well with a brush in the little plastic container they give you, so I pulled out one of my coloring bottles and I poured the powder in and then used the plastic container to measure the water and I used both boxes as directed.  I shook it up and went for it.  There is no stinky smell, it wasn't messy and it was quick!  I washed out the dye, dried my hair, and instantly fell in love! I'm sold forever!  My hair is just past my shoulders and layered.  Next time I will not use two boxes, because I had to toss out a lot of it in the end.  I will more than likely use a box and a half, which should be perfect.  Great product, great price, easy to use...PERFECT!!","Wonderful!",1382140800,"Wonderful!

It has worked fine but I keep trying different brands hoping to get a DEEP black color that lasts.  I have yet to find such a thing until now!  I've tried several types from the beauty supply store but this time I walked in and went up to the sales girl and said, \"I NEED a black color that will stay and I want it to be very black, what do you have?\"  She offered me two kinds with Bigen being one of them.  I was skeptical because it was a powder that you mix with water but the hair swatch was so beautiful and the sales girl told me that it would last and it WAS very dark.  So, I bought it.  It was on sale for 3.00 a box and she suggested two boxes (which I've never had to do), but it was fine.  Then I got home and chose to color immediately.  Logic told me there was NO way that the color was going to work well with a brush in the little plastic container they give you, so I pulled out one of my coloring bottles and I poured the powder in and then used the plastic container to measure the water and I used both boxes as directed.  I shook it up and went for it.  There is no stinky smell, it wasn't messy and it was quick!  I washed out the dye, dried my hair, and instantly fell in love! I'm sold forever!  My hair is just past my shoulders and layered.  Next time I will not use two boxes, because I had to toss out a lot of it in the end.  I will more than likely use a box and a half, which should be perfect.  Great product, great price, easy to use...PERFECT!!",1.0,["wonderful!","i","would","like","to","start","off","by","saying","that","i","did","not","purchase","this","item","from","amazon","however","i","will","the","next","time","but","in","bulk!!!","i","was","in","a","hurry","to","get","some","hair","color","i","typically","go","to","my","local","beauty","supply","store","and","i","get","some","hair","color","to","mix","with","my","developer","and","then","i","color","away","it","has","worked","fine","but","i","keep","trying","different","brands","hoping","to","get","a","deep","black","color","that","lasts","i","have","yet","to","find","such","a","thing","until","now!","i've","tried","several","types","from","the","beauty","supply","store","but","this","time","i","walked","in","and","went","up","to","the","sales","girl","and","said","i","need","a","black","color","that","will","stay","and","i","want","it","to","be","very","black","what","do","you","have?","she","offered","me","two","kinds","with","bigen","being","one","of","them","i","was","skeptical","because","it","was","a","powder","that","you","mix","with","water","but","the","hair","swatch","was","so","beautiful","and","the","sales","girl","told","me","that","it","would","last","and","it","was","very","dark","so","i","bought","it","it","was","on","sale","for","3","00","a","box","and","she","suggested","two","boxes","which","i've","never","had","to","do","but","it","was","fine","then","i","got","home","and","chose","to","color","immediately","logic","told","me","there","was","no","way","that","the","color","was","going","to","work","well","with","a","brush","in","the","little","plastic","container","they","give","you","so","i","pulled","out","one","of","my","coloring","bottles","and","i","poured","the","powder","in","and","then","used","the","plastic","container","to","measure","the","water","and","i","used","both","boxes","as","directed","i","shook","it","up","and","went","for","it","there","is","no","stinky","smell","it","wasn't","messy","and","it","was","quick!","i","washed","out","the","dye","dried","my","hair","and","instantly","fell","in","love!","i'm","sold","forever!","my","hair","is","just","past","my","shoulders","and","layered","next","time","i","will","not","use","two","boxes","because","i","had","to","toss","out","a","lot","of","it","in","the","end","i","will","more","than","likely","use","a","box","and","a","half","which","should","be","perfect","great","product","great","price","easy","to","use","perfect!!"],["wonderful!","like","start","saying","purchase","item","amazon","however","next","time","bulk!!!","hurry","get","hair","color","typically","go","local","beauty","supply","store","get","hair","color","mix","developer","color","away","worked","fine","keep","trying","different","brands","hoping","get","deep","black","color","lasts","yet","find","thing","now!","tried","several","types","beauty","supply","store","time","walked","went","sales","girl","said","need","black","color","stay","want","black","have?","offered","two","kinds","bigen","one","skeptical","powder","mix","water","hair","swatch","beautiful","sales","girl","told","last","dark","bought","sale","3","00","box","suggested","two","boxes","never","fine","got","home","chose","color","immediately","logic","told","way","color","going","work","well","brush","little","plastic","container","give","pulled","one","coloring","bottles","poured","powder","used","plastic","container","measure","water","used","boxes","directed","shook","went","stinky","smell","messy","quick!","washed","dye","dried","hair","instantly","fell","love!","sold","forever!","hair","past","shoulders","layered","next","time","use","two","boxes","toss","lot","end","likely","use","box","half","perfect","great","product","great","price","easy","use","perfect!!"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,11,12,19,21,22,23,25,26,31,34,39,49,62,63,64,65,68,75,82,83,84,86,87,88,92,96,104,109,110,117,120,135,139,147,154,162,178,182,201,203,204,206,208,214,239,251,254,263,268,287,291,293,298,397,402,409,420,481,500,503,528,533,555,562,601,700,723,744,788,851,867,882,923,934,949,992,1048,1061,1102,1117,1157,1188,1244,1432,1519,1643,1695,1698,1800,1844,1950,2189,2261,2297,2351,2725,2873,2980,3121,3232,3452,3516,3595,5835,5863,5962,6224,7045,9505,13628,14570,23252,23262],"values":[1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,11,12,19,21,22,23,25,26,31,34,39,49,62,63,64,65,68,75,82,83,84,86,87,88,92,96,104,109,110,117,120,135,139,147,154,162,178,182,201,203,204,2

PERFECT for summer.I'm also a fan of cream or cream to powder products to begin with, so to have this, and rouge a little on my cheeks after some nice, sheer foundation is the perfect pop of color and shimmer.WONDERFUL product!",1.0,["multiples!","i","have","the","powder","orgasm","blush","and","let","me","say","i","like","this","much","better","the","first","thing","i","did","with","it","was","recycle","one","of","bobbi","brown's","beautiful","compacts","and","melted","down","a","coin","of","this","to","pour","into","the","container","alone","with","a","little","grapefruit","chapstick","and","that's","the","best","decision","i've","made","with","it","so","far","it's","such","a","pretty","shimmery","color","perfect","for","summer","i'm","also","a","fan","of","cream","or","cream","to","powder","products","to","begin","with","so","to","have","this","and","rouge","a","little","on","my","cheeks","after","some","nice","sheer","foundation","is","the","perfect","pop","of","color","and","shimmer","wonderful","product!"],["multiples!","powder","orgasm","blush","let","say","like","much","better","first","thing","recycle","one","bobbi","brown's","beautiful","compacts","melted","coin","pour","container","alone","little","grapefruit","chapstick","best","decision","made","far","pretty","shimmery","color","perfect","summer","also","fan","cream","cream","powder","products","begin","rouge","little","cheeks","nice","sheer","foundation","perfect","pop","color","shimmer","wonderful","product!"],{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[0,4,16,18,20,21,23,27,37,38,54,58,68,85,106,110,143,176,204,383,407,409,410,431,517,872,976,982,992,1198,1355,1424,1688,1999,3009,3607,3815,4319,5140,5842,6237,9395,9588,9892,13532,13879,15191],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},{"vectorType":"sparse","length":87097,"indices":[0,4,16,18,20,21,23,27,37,38,54,58,68,85,106,110,143,176,204,383,407,409,410,431,517,872,976,982,992,1198,1355,1424,1688,1999,3009,3607,3815,4319,5140,5842,6237,9395,9588,9892,13532,13879,15191],"values":[1.164559373231506,1.6468869456094777,2.041750122506523,2.0655068958811857,2.111661726207731,4.609033854914262,4.364377298438246,2.261127716374541,2.392295206069719,2.3972279871753743,2.8284650108009304,2.703966434891522,5.595520628355766,2.9097565542511075,3.0609820890595034,3.0346889204628344,7.386863517698605,3.366585041198616,3.59468196724002,4.016121855955919,4.553050103624547,8.909478342761966,4.08787906921702,4.186915907578806,4.347133985869333,4.958515211732711,5.246197284184492,5.081476922867546,5.271303205315569,5.659961195107352,5.643431893156141,5.557103809667644,5.793492587731874,6.198957695840038,6.576251926981507,6.921092413273236,6.981717035089671,7.356410484531081,7.451720664335406,7.844763252445014,7.808395608274139,8.575650760987806,8.943375541113124,8.655693468661342,9.19468996939403,9.19468996939403,9.19468996939403]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[-4.377556471568349,4.377556471568349]},{"vectorType":"dense","length":2,"values":[0.012400303873201688,0.9875996961267983]},1.0],["B00021DDYW",5.0,"This color is perfect for me, and the quality of the lipstick is top notch.

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)</td><td>Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy</td><td>1401840000</td><td>Industrial strength degreaser. \"Fullness\" is caused by stripping oils and making hair fluffy I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner.

She's currently out of work (recently had a baby) and hadn't dyed her hair in months (pregnant), so we decided it would be fun to do. She chose this color because it's a bit deeper than she normally does, and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she doesn't have to work. Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red (which we've done before with her usual reds, and it always works out well), but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it's in the light. It's like purple-red black. It's lightened up after a wash or two, but still much darker than she anticipated. We didn't even bother with step 2, adding Manic Panic over sections, because we know it's so dark it won't make much of, if any, difference. It's a nice color, but not anything like it looks on the box. She's very fair (like me, which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I've used personally), so it's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said, the dye itself works well, processes quickly, and wasn't overly damaging to her hair. The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also (she has very long, thick, curly hair). The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected, but it then turned purple-ish as it processed.</td><td>Much darker than it appears on the box</td><td>1397952000</td><td>Much darker than it appears on the box I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot.

It smells nice, and glides onto your face like frosting. Your skin feels luxurious afterwards. Then, I read an article about the potential dangers of parabens in skin cream and checked the label. Low and behold, I was very sad to see that Eucerin Q10 Anti-wrinkle cream contains lots of parabens. While we don't know for sure that parabens are bad for us, it sounds like a pretty good bet. Like BPA, parabens mimic estrogen and may lead to breast cancer, premature puberty in girls, and studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage. I'm guessing that it's more a combination of skin creams, BPA, birth control, deodorant, and all the other chemicals we're exposed to on a daily basis that may be correlated to breast cancer, but why risk it.

Thought the soybeans would even skin tone or brighten...something! Nothing.Pros:Good coverage. I stopped using foundation when I started using this.Convienent pump bottle that locks for traveling.Size of the bottle will last FOREVER. One pump and your good to go.  If you use more than this, YOU WILL BE GREASY.Good for every day use. When I know I am going to be out in the sun all day, I use a 50 spf zinc cream.

I know masks are caused by hormones, but the sun accensenuates them. While I don't burn with this product, (I might get a little red, but not fry) this did not protect against the sun enough. Last winter,  I watched my mask fade. When the summer hit (after the baby was 9 months old) I would go back in the sun and it brought my mask out again in full force. I think this doesn't shield enough from the sun.I am currently looking for another lotion that has SPF and color that isn't greasy & won't sting my eyes. I have only continued to use this because most tinted moisturizers with spf are the same price for only 1.5 - 2 ounces.

The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn't seem like enough so I always have to do at lest two.  I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it lathers up very nice.  Everyone has different skin and everyone's skin reacts differently to products.  This product hasn't broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.

I put it on though because oils can smell different on the body then it does in the jar. 4 hours later and its still pretty sweet...not as bad as it was when I first put it on , but definitely smelling even less like coconut.

The best hair growth was on my face.  I'm blonde and developed peach-fuzz on my cheeks, and single dark hairs on my forehead and cheeks as well as my chin.  I'm post-menopausal and realize that hair growth happens, but since stopping Rogaine I no longer have a facial hair problem, other than an occasional dark hair on my chin.  I'm content to use Pantene Anti-breakage shampoo/conditioner and a styling gel.  My hair looks better and is certainly less brittle and dry.  It also is a better color than during the years of Rogaine use.  Those who are blonde may notice that the roots always look darker when using Rogaine, and hair greys more readily.  There are several articles on long-term Rogaine use online, and I think I've reached the point of diminishing returns with this product.</td><td>Long-term user</td><td>1370736000</td><td>Long-term user I've been using Rogaine since it came on the market, but recently noticed that it inflames my scalp and that I'm losing hair rather than growing more, as well as experiencing dizzy spells after use.

I'm post-menopausal and realize that hair growth happens, but since stopping Rogaine I no longer have a facial hair problem, other than an occasional dark hair on my chin.  I'm content to use Pantene Anti-breakage shampoo/conditioner and a styling gel.  My hair looks better and is certainly less brittle and dry.  It also is a better color than during the years of Rogaine use.  Those who are blonde may notice that the roots always look darker when using Rogaine, and hair greys more readily.  There are several articles on long-term Rogaine use online, and I think I've reached the point of diminishing returns with this product.</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(long-term, user, i've, been, using,

Formula was easy, but a bit on the thin side, and I've found that Essie's brushes are small. This is my 2nd Essie bottle and I don't like their brushes vs OPI, China Glaze, etc other brands. I guess because my size of my nails are the average size so applying it takes more strokes vs someone with a smaller nail bed. I hope that's the right term to describe your nail size?So if I had to choose which color.

I was skeptical because it was a powder that you mix with water but the hair swatch was so beautiful and the sales girl told me that it would last and it WAS very dark.  So, I bought it.  It was on sale for 3.00 a box and she suggested two boxes (which I've never had to do), but it was fine.  Then I got home and chose to color immediately.  Logic told me there was NO way that the color was going to work well with a brush in the little plastic container they give you, so I pulled out one of my coloring bottles and I poured the powder in and then used the plastic container to measure the water and I used both boxes as directed.  I shook it up and went for it.  There is no stinky smell, it wasn't messy and it was quick!  I washed out the dye, dried my hair, and instantly fell in love! I'm sold forever!  My hair is just past my shoulders and layered.  Next time I will not use two boxes, because I had to toss out a lot of it in the end.

I used it for the first time yesterday, and, even though I followed all of the directions and even contacted their customer service for advice before dying, it left me with bright orange \"hot roots\" and left my hair feeling very damaged and dry.I bought this in the Terracotta Blonde color (7C).  Before purchasing it from Amazon, I went to the Naturtint website to check out the color chart, and then found it locally so I could see the color chart in person.  Since I still wasn't sure what color to get and was trying to go to a lighter red than my current color, I emailed a photo of my hair to Naturtint's customer service email. Someone emailed me back right away with two suggested colors -- and so they definitely have excellent customer service!This color contain hydrogen peroxide, which means that it can lighten your hair over time.  If you want to move to a lighter shade, you can use Naturtint to do so gradually, by slowly going down two shades at a time.  The peroxide, however, is probably what makes this so drying on your hair; it left my hair feeling awful afterwards.That being said, when I rinsed this out of my hair, it took forever to rinse and burned my eyes really badly as I was rinsing it out.  It also left my hair feeling like straw, and I had very healthy hair to begin with.  Even after using their shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt awful, so I did a deep treatment with one of my own hair masques, and that seemed to help a bit.  Overall, though, my hair feels really dry and straw-like, and I had a lot of residual color left on my towels and pillowcase last night, which I've never had before.When I told my stylist that I was going to start dying my own hair again, she said just to do an all-over color every four or five or so colorings when doing box color, and just touch up the roots in the meantime.  I'd like to do so, but this seems to be so damaging to my hair that I'm not sure I want to use it again.  Before now, I was using Robert Craig color, which left my hair in much nicer condition, but was more of a pain to use because you have to measure and mix up the color.

That's why I rated this bar a 4.  As far as the way Fresh Farmacy works, I LOVE it.  I ust took off one star because as I get to the ending part of a piece, I noticed the bar is really rough and I don't get as much lather out of it like I used to.  I've never tried storing it in a sealed container, but that may actually work better.I know you're suppose to let it dry out completely before storing, but my boyfriend just throws it in a zip lock bag when he's done using it.  He doesn't seal the bag, but it keeps enough moisture in it to keep the bar moist, not mushy.  I may try this way and if it works, I will update this review.Fresh Farmacy and Coalface (see my review) are still the only facial cleanser I use and my skin has been clear ever since.</td><td>Worth every penny and definately works.</td><td>1179187200</td><td>Worth every penny and definately works.

It has rice proteins and aloe in it which is great for keeping moisture in your hair. Smells good too!  I've learned that for my hair I need to apply an oil after using Botanical Boost to seal it and really lock in that moisture.  Once I've sealed it, the Botanical Boost locks in moisture and keeps my curls nice and fresh (I seal with a little Jojoba oil or either Ouidad's Climate Control Frizz and Flyaway Fighter).  If I don't seal after using the Botanical Boost, my hair tends to look dry which makes it appear dull even though it is moist to touch but is lacking that moisturizing sheen I adore. If that happens to you when using this product, just seal it by applying a little Jojoba or Almond oil after misting with Botanical Boost and you'll notice that you will have all of that great moisture you were seeking.Ingredients:  Water, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Spirulina Maxima Extract, Methyl Gluceth-10, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Benzophenone-4, Benzalkonium Chloride, Fragrance, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin.</td><td>Helps Lock in Moisture</td><td>1373673600</td><td>Helps Lock in Moisture I use Botanical Boost on my 2c/3a hair every morning whether I'm going curly or wearing a wavy roller-set style.

And for all that torture, the new formula takes twice as much to do the job and the color starts looking dull almost immediately after just a couple of washes.

But after just a few tries with the new Natural Instincts, I would rather do permanent coloring at the salon or even just go totally natural (i.e. gray). Either would be far far better than the torture and bad results from the new Natural Instincts.
